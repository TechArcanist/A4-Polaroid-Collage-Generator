## How It Works

The **A4-Polaroid-Collage-Generator** allows users to upload up to 6 Polaroid-style images. The program automatically arranges these images into a 2x3 grid on a standard A4-sized sheet. Once the images are combined, the output is saved as a **JPEG** file, which can then be printed for your collection of Polaroid memories.

### Steps:
1. Click on **"Select and Combine Images"**.
